### Textbook: Introduction to Statistical Learning
by James, Whitten, Hastie, & Tibshirani (2E, 2009, Springer)
http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/

Welcome to Statistical Learning!
Your learning adventure with Trevor, Rob and their team begins today.

The course follows closely the sequence of chapters in the course text 
"An Introduction to Statistical Learning, with Applications in R" (James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani - Springer 2013). 
Remember, this textbook is available for free online at http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/.

The first week will be an overview of Statistical Learning, and will cover the first two chapters of the book. On each subsequent Saturday we will release the materials for a new chapter. Here is the schedule in detail:

We hope that you will follow along with the class each week and share your comments and questions along the way. However, if you join the class late or are unavailable for a week, access to the material from previous weeks will remain open. Notice that we give you quite a long period from end of week 9 till the course termination. The deadline for completing all the requirements to get your Statement of Accomplishment is April 4.

To pass the course you need to get 50% or more correct answers on the quiz questions. If you score 90% or higher, your statement will be "with distinction".

To see the course materials, click on the Courseware tab on the upper left of the entry page. You'll see the sequence of sections in this course listed on the left. Click on a section to see its subsections, and click on a subsection to see its units, which contain videos, questions, etc. Within a given subsection, you can move from one unit to the next by clicking the next icons, which appear at the top and bottom of each page. The sequence of sections, subsections, and units is intended to be experienced in order.
Versions of the class videos are available for download. If you look under any section's video, you will see a "Download video" button. If you click that, you can download and save the video on your device. These are not as high resolution as the class video, but if you also download the pdf slides for each chapter, you should be fine.

It's a pleasure to have you as part of the course. Enjoy the journey!
